      <h1>France- Pioneer of Plastic Ban</h1>
      <span></span>
      <p>France is the first country to pass a law banning all kinds of plastic - plates, cups, and utensils to combat the problem of
         plastic pollution. As per the â€˜Plastic Ban' law passed in 2016, replacements made with the plastic items must be bio-degradable 
         which can be further composted.The law has completely banned plastic shopping bags and aims to half city's plastic usage by 2025

      <h1>Rwanda- Plastic Bag Free</h1>
      <span></span>
      <p>Rwanda was one of the first countries to eliminate the usage of plastic bags by putting a ban on plastic bags in 2008. The 
        country was faced with the problem of plastic bags chocking waterways and destroying the country's ecosystem. To fight this 
        problem the country passed a law banning all non-biodegradable plastic from the country. Anyone found using or smuggling plastic
         bags are heavily penalised and in some cases may face a jail term

      <h1>Sweden- The Plastic Recycler</h1>
      <span></span>
      <p>The country has officially run out of trash and is asking other countries for their garbage to keep its recycling plant running.
         Following the mantra of 'No Plastic Ban, Instead More Plastic Recycling', Sweden burns most of its waste in incinerators.
          Sweden has tackled the plastic pollution at source by organsiing several campaigns Less than one per cent of waste from 
          Swedish households goes to landfill dumps. No wonder this country boasts of being one of the world's best recycling nations

      <h1>Ireland- Tax Leverage on Plastic</h1>
      <span></span>
      <p>In 2002, the country passed a plastic bag tax under which consumers would have to purchase bags. The law was tremendously 
        successful as within weeks of its implementation there was a reduction of 94 percent in plastic bag use. Presently, plastic 
        bags are illegal in Ireland
